        😐 Tired of staring at error messages that make no sense? Need a break
        from debugging that one bug that only happens in production? You’re in
        the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        😁 Whether you're a seasoned coder, a newbie still figuring out Git, or
        just someone who enjoys watching developers suffer (looking at you,
        project managers), we’ve got something for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        😍 So grab some coffee, open a new Stack Overflow tab (just in case),
        and dive into the world where code is buggy, deadlines are a joke, and
        the only thing running smoothly is our humor.
